**USING ANY OTHER FILE STRUCTURE BESIDES THE ONE PROVIDED WILL RESULT IN SPHINX NOT WORKING CORRECTLY**

In this directory is everything you requested (Word documents and Python scripts) as well as the required items for Sphinx. To see the Sphinx documentation I created, head to /Sphinx/Build/ and open index.html. Also in that folder is a PDF version of the documentation (project2.pdf). Inside of /Sphinx/Source is conf.py and index.rst. conf.py is simply configuration data. index.rst is the actual content that creates the documentation.

Capture.JPG is used when executing enhance.py

cli4sphinx.JPG shows the command line creation of the documentation via Sphinx

enhance_proof.png shows the original and upscaled images side by side as well as the properties of each (showing resolution).

LapSRN_x4.pb is required for enhance.py

upscaled_Capture.jpg will be created upon execution of enhance.py. If you use a different image, it will have the same name with "upscaled_" prepended.
